                <AccordionTrigger className="text-sm font-semibold text-foreground hover:text-primary">Is it better to buy a used or rebuilt transmission?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent className="text-[13px] text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  The first concern is price. Although used transmissions are less expensive, they may not last as long as rebuilt transmissions. Although rebuilding is more expensive, it may provide a longer-lasting solution. If you are mechanically inclined, you might be able to rebuild it yourself for better results.

                <AccordionContent className="text-[13px] text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Purchase from a salvage yard or individual. Find a rebuilder who may save you money by repairing your existing transmission. Negotiate a reduced price with your mechanic or dealership. Always conduct thorough research and obtain multiple quotes.

                <AccordionContent className="text-[13px] text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Many salvage yards and individual merchants offer warranties on their used parts. You can also look for a used transmission that still has the manufacturer warranty. Third-party warranty companies are also an option. Always examine the terms and conditions carefully.
